# Recipes

## React Native and TypeScript

Draqula supports React Native out-of-the-box, but there are a few extra steps
needed if you're using TypeScript.

- Make sure you are using Draqula v0.5.3 or higher
- Update TypeScript config to include `AsyncIterableIterator` type

Add `esnext.asynciterable` to `compilerOptions.lib` in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"lib": ["es6", "esnext.asynciterable"]
	}
}
```

- Patch `ky` to not include DOM types

First, install [`patch-package`](https://npmjs.com/package/patch-package) and
set up a `postinstall` script according to instructions in its readme.

Afterwards, download a `ky` patch (compatible with `ky@0.12.0` as of this writing) and put it in `patches` folder:

```bash
$ mkdir patches
$ curl https://draqulajs.com/ky+0.12.0.patch > patches/ky+0.12.0.patch
$ npx patch-package
```
